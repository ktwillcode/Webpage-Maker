Elements in the following list are entirely obsolete, and must not be used by authors:

applet
Use embed or object instead.

acronym
Use abbr instead.

bgsound
Use audio instead.

dir
Use ul instead.

frame
frameset
noframes
Either use iframe and CSS instead, or use server-side includes to generate complete pages with the various invariant parts merged in.

isindex
Use an explicit form and text field combination instead.

listing
xmp
Use pre and code instead.

nextid
Use GUIDs instead.

noembed
Use object instead of embed when fallback is necessary.

plaintext
Use the "text/plain" MIME type instead.

rb
Providing the ruby base directly inside the ruby element is sufficient; the rb element is unnecessary. Omit it altogether.

basefont
big
blink
center
font
marquee
multicol
nobr
s
spacer
strike
tt
u
wbr
Use appropriate elements and/or CSS instead.

For the s and strike elements, if they are marking up a removal from the element, consider using the del element instead.

Where the tt element would have been used for marking up keyboard input, consider the kbd element; for variables, consider the var element; for computer code, consider the code element; and for computer output, consider the samp element.

Similarly, if the u element is being used to indicate emphasis, consider using the em element; if it is being used for marking up keywords, consider the b element; and if it is being used for highlighting text for reference purposes, consider the mark element.

See also the text-level semantics usage summary for more suggestions with examples.

nohref on area elements
Omitting the href attribute is sufficient; the nohref attribute is unnecessary. Omit it altogether.
